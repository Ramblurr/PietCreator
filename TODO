TODO

Oh so much...

* Breakpoints
* Selection and movement of blocks
* Sub programs (like layers in a normal graphics editor)
* Given a program refactor it to change its colors but not its functionality
* Per-codel comments
* Mouse over information (command, value, etc)
* Given several subprograms automatically connect them

TODOs related to Piet but not Piet Creator specifically:
* Implement a "standard library" of programs
    * and, or, xor, complement, read string, out string, reverse string, etc.
* Create roll visualizer -- DONE -- http://binaryelysium.com/code/roll-vis.html
